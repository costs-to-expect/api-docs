## Resource types

In the Costs to Expect API there are three levels, resource types -> resources -> items.

Items are the individual items defined by the resource type, these coupld be expenses, items on your budget tracker or board game scoring.

Resources are the names for the collections, lists or trackers.

Resource types are the base and where we define the item type we are tracking or forecasting.

The resources in a resource type all use the same tracking or forecasting method. The categories and subcategories defined for a resource type are shared among all the resources.
