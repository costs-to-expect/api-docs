## Resource types

In the Costs to Expect API there are three core levels, resource types -> resources -> items.

Items are the individual items defined by the resource type, these coupld be expenses, items on your Budget or board games for our scoring App.

Resources are the names for the collections, lists or trackers.

Resource types are the base and where we define the item type as well as permitted users and public visibility status.

Any categories and subcategories defined for a resource type are shared among all the resources. Different item types use categories and subcategories in different ways. For the 'allocated-expense' item type, category and subcategories are the expense type, for the 'game' item type, categories are the available players.
