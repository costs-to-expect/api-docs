# API Sections

There is an OPTIONS endpoint for each route, they largely include this documentation, or more accurately, this documentation was created from the OPTIONS request responses. Although we strive to ensure the documentation is up to date, the OPTIONS request responses should always have the most accurate information.

We have tried to layout this file to match the structure of the API, for some routes that doesn't make sense, we will probably have tacked them on the end.

## Structure Overview

In the Costs to Expect API there are three levels to the main data, `resource types` -> `resources` -> `items`, please review the sections below for additional information on each entity.

## Routes and Verbs

Below is a title for each route and the corresponding verbs, the OPTIONS verb is not listed however there is an OPTIONS endpoint for each route.

*Typically, in addition to the docs, the GET route for the collection includes an overview.*
