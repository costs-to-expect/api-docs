# Item types - GET

View the available item types.

Item types dictate the type of item that gets added below a resource, item types adjust both the structure of the item object and the functions available.

*Support for new item types needs to be added in the code, we don't allow it to be changed via the API so no POST endpoint*

## Supported item types 

The Costs to Expect API, supports three item types:

### Allocated Expense

Chronological expenses tracking, use by the [Expense](https://app.costs-to-expect.com) App. In addition to defining the data for an expense, you can set a publish after date and allocate a percentage of the total cost. Expenses can be partially transferred to other resources to split the cost and transferred entirely to another resource to move the cost.

### Budget

Budgets items are used by the [Budget](https://budget.costs-to-expect.com) App. Budgets items are a definition of a planned expense and the frequency with which is occurs.

### Game

Game items are used by out scoring Apps, [Yahtzee](https://yahtzee.game-scorer.com) and [Yatzy](https://yatzy.game-scorer.com). Game items are specific to the game but typically they are used to record the players, the winner(s) and the final score.
